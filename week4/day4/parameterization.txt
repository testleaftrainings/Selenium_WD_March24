Steps to Integrate Precondition() and PostCondition();
1.Create a new class as Project Specific Method
2.we have to create two methods here, The methodsa are preCondition() and postCondition()
3.declare the driver instance as global variable,make sure remove the local declaration 
   i.e
       ChromeDriver driver;
	
	@BeforeMethod
	public void preCondition() {
	    driver = new ChromeDriver();
        -------------------------------
        }

4.All the class should be extends with project specific method



priority is a attribute to controll the order of execution with in class
Priority default value is 0
we can able to either positive nor negative


Subraction
Multiplication
Division
Addition

invocationCount is attribute
to execute single testcase in multiple times
we can able to either positive nor negative
if you are give negative value it will not allow to execute.
            or 0  -it will not allow to execute


If i don't execute particular testcase at that we should use enabled attribute
default value is true

@Test(enabled=false)  --not consider in execution



Parameterization:
  To pass external data to testcase
1.static  
url username password
2.Dynamic
