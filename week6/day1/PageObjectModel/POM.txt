base
    to have BaseClass common properties
    PreCondition() and postCondition()
pages
    we can able to create multiple java classes
    to have java classes for all the pages that we navigate in the application
testcase
     Depends on  pages, we can able to create multiple java classes

Steps to Implement PageObjectModel
1.Create a new Project named as PageObjectModel
2.Add the necessary dependencies in pom.xml file
3.Create below packages under src/main/java
       i.base
      ii.pages
     iii.testcase
      iv.utills
4.under base package we have to create two methods as preCondition()
  and postCondition() and also add necessary code in base class
  Declare the chrome driver as global variable and make it add static keyword
  i.e
  public static ChromeDriver driver

5.Create java classes for each pages that we navigate in the appplication
   --6 java classes under page packages
   --All the pages are should extends with BaseClass
   --Create a method in each actions/ verifications in the respective pages
      java class with appropriate code for each actions and verifications
   --Apply return statement for all the methods in pages
     this -->same page
    new PageClass() -> for another page
6.Create a java class under testcase package
  Here all the java classes should extends with baseclass
  create a new method and top of the method put @Test annatations

              BaseClass
    Pages            Testcase
